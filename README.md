  * **red_to_green_ratio.txt**  
This script will help quickly evaluate the ratio of red candles to green candles for a given length.  The idea here is
when the ratio of red to green candles turn to 3:2 (i.e., amount of red candles significantly outnumbers green candles), this indicates the bears are winning. In this case, the trader may want to tighten the trailing stop or exit the position if price action moves under the prior day's low.

* **close_to_sma_distance.txt**  
A simple script to use for custom columns, this will calculate the distance between the closing price of the candle bar to the a 20 SMA line.  The distance can be used as a way to gauge how strong the bearish/bullish momentum is.
