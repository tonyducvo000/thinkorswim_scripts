red_to_green_ratio.txt
This script will help quickly evaluate the ratio of red candles to green candles for a given length.  The idea here is
when the ratio of red to green candles turn to 3:2 (i.e., amount of red candles significantly outnumbers green candles) then the bears are winning. In this case, 
tighten your trailing stop or exit the position if price action moves against you under the prior day's low.
